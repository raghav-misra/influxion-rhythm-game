### What Is Influxion?
To fit with the theme of the music jam (music if that wasn't obvious), we built Influxion because we guessed that many of the other submissions would be music players, music builders, et cetera. We wanted our project to be different but fun to play/use nevertheless. **Influxion** blends the elements of a rhythm game into a less strict and more approachable platformer game.

---
### Game Structure/How-To-Play:
 - Influxion has **7 CDs (or levels)** built-in, along with many others created by players.
 - Each **CD** is divided into **2 parts**, the **platformer** and the **boss battle**.
 - The platformer is pretty straight forward, you hit **(SPACE)** to avoid crashing into **eighth notes**, and press **(X)** to attack **treble clefs**.
 - The boss battle is a bit more complex, and is only playable after the platformer is **completed**.
 - **The boss** is constantly moving around synced to the beat and your goal is to survive it or kill it. When the boss is hovered over the **left-most (red) bar**, you use the **(A)** key to hit the boss, for the **inner-left (blue) bar** use the **(S)** key, for the **inner-right (yellow) bar** use the **(D)**  key, and for the **outer-right (green) bar**.

### Level Designer

 - Just click **'MAKE A LEVEL'** from the homepage and type in a username.
 - All further instructions will be on the page itself.

### Further Notes:
 - All Influxion code was designed in **Repl.It**, and tested in **Google Chrome 75** on **Windows 10**
 - Influxion was designed to be played on a computer, and does not work on a phone.
 - As Influxion is an music-focused game, for optimal experience headphones are recommended.
 - Play Influxion in fullscreen, if your browser can do that.
 - **DISCLAIMER:** We are not responsible for copyright issues in community levels as those were not created by us.
 - If a song in a community level is explicit, racist, sexist, et cetera, please let us know thrugh a comment or on Discord (@RustyPotato#3472) through the [Repl.It server](https://repl.it/discord).
